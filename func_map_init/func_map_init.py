    Initializes a FuncMapInit object and a function map.
    
    The `FuncMapInit` class is responsible for initializing a function map, which is a data structure that maps function names to their corresponding function objects. This is likely used to provide a centralized way to look up and execute functions by name.
    
    The `__init__` method prints a message indicating that the FuncMapInit object is being initialized.
    
    The `initialize_function_map` method prints a message indicating that the function map is being initialized.
