# Project Plan for AI Code Generation System

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the project plan for developing a software system that uses AI agents to automatically generate code. The system will leverage artificial intelligence to interpret requirements and produce corresponding code snippets or modules, aiming to streamline software development processes.

## 2. Project Scope
The scope of this project includes:
- Designing AI agents capable of understanding software requirements.
- Developing a system that allows these agents to generate code based on interpreted requirements.
- Creating a user interface to input requirements and display generated code.
- Implementing a testing framework to validate the generated code against the initial requirements.

## 3. Requirements Documentation
### 3.1 Functional Requirements
1. **Input Interpretation**: The system shall allow users to input their software requirements in natural language.
2. **Code Generation**: Based on the interpreted requirements, the system shall generate code in multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, and Java).
3. **Code Output**: The system shall present the generated code to the user for review and use.

### 3.2 Non-functional Requirements
1. **Accuracy**: The code generated should accurately reflect the input requirements.
2. **Usability**: The system should be user-friendly, allowing users with minimal technical knowledge to input requirements and retrieve code.
3. **Performance**: The system should generate code within a reasonable time frame (e.g., a few seconds for simple requirements).

## 4. System Architecture
### 4.1 Overview
The system architecture consists of the following main components:
- **User Interface (UI)**: For inputting requirements and displaying generated code.
- **AI Code Generator**: Core component that processes input and generates code.
- **Testing Framework**: Validates the generated code against requirements.
