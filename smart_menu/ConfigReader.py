        Reads a configuration file and returns its contents as a data structure.
        
        This method attempts to open and read a JSON configuration file specified by `file_path`. 
        If successful, it returns the contents of the file as a Python data structure (typically a dictionary or a list, 
        depending on the JSON structure). If the file cannot be found, or if the file is not valid JSON, appropriate 
        error messages are printed, and an empty list is returned.
        
        Parameters:
        - file_path (str): The path to the configuration file that is to be read.
        
        Returns:
        - list/dict: The content of the configuration file parsed from JSON. If an error occurs, an empty list is returned.
        
        Exceptions:
        - FileNotFoundError: If the file specified by `file_path` does not exist, a message is printed indicating that 
          the file was not found, and an empty list is returned.
        - json.JSONDecodeError: If the file specified by `file_path` is not valid JSON, a message is printed indicating 
          that there was an error decoding the file, and an empty list is returned.
