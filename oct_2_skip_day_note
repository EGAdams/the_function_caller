Good morning, Roy

I have to do a demo for another project at 1pm in Spring Hill today.  I need to do some road tests for preparation.  This is the project that I should have never taken on and cost me 100s of hours.  It has been the worst decision of my carrer.  This project is nearing end.  It has to come to a close soon.  I will resume tackling the font issue tomorrow morning.
