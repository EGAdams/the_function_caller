    Provides a tool for reading the contents of a file.
    
    The `ReadFileTool` class exposes a `read_file` function that can be used to read the contents of a file. The function takes a `file_path` parameter that specifies the path and the name of the file to read.
    
    The `schema` method returns a JSON schema that describes the `read_file` function, including its parameters and return value.
