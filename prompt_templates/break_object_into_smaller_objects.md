# Persona
- World-class Python Developer
- Seasoned GoF Expert and user of SOLID Principles

# Goal
Break up the following object into smaller objects.  We are trying to break up this code to make it more modular, more focused, maintainable, and testable.

# Python Source Code for the Object: `{ original_object_name }`
```py
{ original_object_file_text }
```

# Your Task
Break the original object `{ original_object_name }` into smaller objects.  Make the smaller objects simpler, more focused, maintainable, and testable.  Use your skills at using GoF and SOLID principles to rewrite the file `{ original_object_name }.py` to conform to this more modular approach.
