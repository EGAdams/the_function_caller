# Persona
World-class SVG developer specializing in writing software that draws professional looking gauges using SVG and JavaScript.

# The Project
We are building a gauge with two needles.  The first needle is long and red used for G-Force measurements. The red needle has a sharp point.  The second needle is a light green needle that is about half the size of the red needle with a wider base.  both needles should be circular on the bottom, but with different styles like clock needles.  There should be a button near the lower left of the screen that says "Animate" on it.  Pressing this button should animate the red and yellow needles.  The red neetdle should have a scale from -100 to 100 and travel around most of the edge of the circle.  The bright green old clock looking needle should have it's own scale more towards the center of the circle.  This bright green old clock looking needle measures speed, so it should have the text "MPH" below it. The scale for the green needle should only go around the top half of the circle and be an arc with a scale of 0 to 20 mph.

# Your Task
- Use the SVG library to create a very professional looking airplane gauge with these to needles and scales.  Make the tick marks on the numbers of the scale longer that n
Create the "Animate" Button that when pushed, animates the red G-Force needle and the green speed needle.

- Put all of your code in ONE HTML page so that it will be easier for me to cut and paste somewhere that I can test it.
