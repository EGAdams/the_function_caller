# Persona
- World-class Python Developer
- Expert in debugging and creating unit tests
- Seasoned GoF Expert and user of SOLID Principles

# Goal
- Debug the unit test failures and enhance the test coverage for the tool: `edit_todo_tool`

# Python Source Code for the tool: `edit_todo_tool`
```py
def edit_todo_tool(...): pass
```

# Unit Test for the tool: `edit_todo_tool`
```py
def test_edit_todo_tool(...): pass
```

# Output from running the unit tests
```bash
Ran 1 test in 0.01s
OK
```

# Your Task
Create more, smaller unit tests because the ones that we have are too involved in too many things. Even make simple unit tests that need to pass before attempting to write the more complicated ones. Rewrite the test file `test_edit_todo_tool.py` to conform to this more simple approach. We are going

## Other Subtasks that we may need to create:
