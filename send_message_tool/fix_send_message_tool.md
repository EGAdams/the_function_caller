This send_message tool is too complicated and needs to be simplified.  Please rewrite it to work with the system that you have drawn the mermaid diagram for.
```python
def send_message(self, recipient_id: str, packaged_message: dict):
    """
    Sends a packaged message (Python dict) to the specified recipient via their ID.

    Args:
        recipient_id (str): The ID of the recipient agent.
        packaged_message (dict): The packaged message to send.

    Returns:
        str: Success or error message.
    """
    recipient_url = self.agents_urls.get(recipient_id)
    if not recipient_url:
        return f"Error: Unknown recipient ID '{recipient_id}'."

    try:
        with xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(recipient_url) as receiving_agent:
            print(f"Sending message to {recipient_id} at {recipient_url}: {packaged_message}")
            
            # Send the packaged message (Python dict) to the recipient
            receiving_agent_response = receiving_agent.receive_message(packaged_message)
            
            # Send the response to the collaborator, if needed
            with xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(self.agents_urls["collaborator"]) as collaborator:
                # Modify the message for the collaborator to include the recipient ID
                collaborator_message = {
                    **packaged_message,
                    "recipient": {"name": recipient_id, "response": receiving_agent_response}
                }
