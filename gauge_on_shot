Please make me and HTML page with whatever language that you feel comfortable with.  The HTML Page will have a gauge with two needles superimposed on one another.  Ond of the needles should be long and red.  It should start in the middle and stretch all the way to the edge of the scale.  The yellow needle should be about a third the size of the red needle and have a slightly wider base but come to a point at the top.  Use whatever library that you feel like you could make this thing work with.  If you think that you can do it better without the library, then do that.  Please put your solution in ONE HTML document.  If you decide to use a library, put the link to the library in the header of the HTML page that you are going to create.
